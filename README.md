## 🔧 How to Run

1. **Clone or download the repository.**
2. Navigate to the `Q1/` directory:
   ```bash
   cd "DAA Assignment/Q1"
   ```
3. Run any of the sorting scripts using Python:
   ```bash
   python quick.py
   python merge.py
   python heapsort.py
   python radix.py
   python bucket.py
   ```



Each file reads from the provided input files, performs sorting, and may print or save the output depending on the script logic.
Each folder contains test case files

## 📄 Reports

- **Report.pdf** – Contains detailed analysis, algorithm comparison, and performance results.
- **Design and Analysis of Algorithms report all.docx** – Editable version of the report.
- **Q2/q2_tc.txt** – Input/output or test case file for the second question.

## 🛠 VS Code Integration

The `.vscode/` directory includes recommended settings and tasks to simplify code execution in Visual Studio Code.
